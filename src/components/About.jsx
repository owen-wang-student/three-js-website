        I'm a skilled software developer with experience in TypeScript and
        JavaScript, and expertise in frameworks like React, Node.js, and
        Three.js. I'm a quick learner and collaborate closely with clients to
        create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions that solve
        real-world problems. Let's work together to bring your ideas to life!
        
        My name is David Hu-Liu, currently a freshman at the University of Waterloo studying Computer Science and at Wilfrid Laurier studying Business. I have a strong interest in Machine Learning and Data Science, full-stack development, Graphic/UX design, and creating products that address real-life problems.


I understand the key principles of data science, along with the underlying mathematics driving machine learning algorithms. Iâ€™ve used javascript and React to create full-stack applications, and utilized various python libraries to create neural networks and object detection.


I want to continue learning about important technologies because I believe technology, including software, has the capacity to shape our future and address societal problems such as sustainability, equality/access to technology, and education. Technology has historically been a catalyst in improving our quality of life, and the future will be no different.


With open arms, I seek to collaborate with others with the shared mindset that technology can drive positive social change. Outside of computer science, my hobbies include snowboarding, fitness, philosophy, and poker.
